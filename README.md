- 🔒 `auth.onAuthStateChanged()` used to protect restricted routes  
- 🔁 Reauthentication required before sensitive actions (like password change)  
- 🛡️ Firestore rules enforce role-based access  
- 📝 All major actions are logged in the `logs` collection  
- ☁️ Firebase Hosting ensures secure and scalable deployment
